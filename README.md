# JavaScript-code


To create a summary report based on the JavaScript code provided, we'll outline the key concepts covered and highlight some examples from the code snippets. Here's a brief summary:

1. **Variables and Data Types**:
   - The code demonstrates variable declaration and initialization for storing different types of data such as strings, numbers, and booleans.
   - Example: `let fullName = "ravi kumar verma";`

2. **Objects**:
   - Objects are used to store multiple related pieces of information together.
   - Example: `const Student = { fullName: "ravi kumar verma", age: 25, cgpa: 6.97, pass: true };`

3. **Operators**:
   - Various arithmetic and logical operators are showcased, including unary operators like increment and decrement.
   - Example: `let result = a + b;`

4. **Conditional Statements**:
   - The code includes if-else statements and the ternary operator for making decisions based on conditions.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     if (age >= 18) {
         console.log("This person is valid for voting.");
     } else {
         console.log("Not valid for voting.");
     }
     ```

5. **Loops**:
   - Demonstrates for loops, while loops, and do-while loops for iterating over a sequence of elements.
   - Example: 
     ```javascript
     for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
         console.log("For loop iteration:", i);
     }
     ```

6. **Functions**:
   - Although not explicitly shown in the code snippets, functions are essential for organizing code into reusable blocks.

7. **String Manipulation**:
   - String methods like `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, `trim()`, etc., are utilized for manipulating strings.
   - Example: `let upperCaseName = str.toUpperCase();`

8. **Switch Statement**:
   - The switch statement is used for multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     switch (expression) {
         case "apple":
             console.log("Fruit item: Apple");
             break;
         case "mobile":
             console.log("Electronic item: Mobile");
             break;
         default:
             console.log("Unknown item");
     }
     ```

9. **Input/Output**:
   - `prompt()` and `console.log()` functions are used for taking user input and displaying output respectively.

10. **Control Flow**:
    - Control flow structures like loops, conditionals, and function calls dictate the execution flow of the program.
